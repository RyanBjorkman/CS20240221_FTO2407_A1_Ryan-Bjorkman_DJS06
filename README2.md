In this solution, I leveraged JavaScriptâ€™s higher-order functions to simplify and streamline data manipulation tasks.

forEach - Used for logging tasks to output each name and province 

map - Used for transformations like converting names to uppercase or calculating lengths without changing the original data

filter - Applied to remove unwanted items, such as provinces containing cape

reduce - Used to accumulate values like calculating total prices 

Object.entries and reduce - Combined to restructure the products array to control the new array with specific keys

This approach emphasizes readability and maintainability by using declarative functions that achieve tasks with minimal code.
